# Expo Camera Preview Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera component with absolute positioning and a parent container styled with `flex: 1`. The camera preview may not render correctly, appearing partially or in an unexpected location. This inconsistency is observed across different devices and Expo SDK versions.

## Bug Description

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Start the Expo development server.
4. Observe the inconsistent rendering of the camera preview on different devices and/or Expo SDK versions.

## Solution
The solution provided addresses the inconsistent rendering issue.  See `bugSolution.js` for details on how to reliably render the camera preview.
