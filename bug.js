This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Camera` component with custom styling.  The issue arises when attempting to position the camera preview absolutely within a parent container, particularly when using `flex: 1` on the parent. The camera preview either doesn't render, renders partially, or renders in the wrong position. This is inconsistent and depends on the device and Expo SDK version.
